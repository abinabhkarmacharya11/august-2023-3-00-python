# Lists are the mutable datatypes in python
# They are the sequential datatyes i.e. the iterables
# Lists are created by enclosing elements in big brackets, separated by comma

# Creating an empty list
data = []
print (data) # []
data = list() # using list () built-in function
print (data) # []

# List may not contain homogenous data. Elements may vary in datatype
